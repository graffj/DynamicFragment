# DynamicFragment
Example implementation of a very simple case for dynamic fragment switching in Android.
Both fragments are loaded programatically (from onStart and onClick). A button in the UI switches between the two fragments.
This example helps illustrate basic use of the FragmentManager class, back stack, and fragment transactions.
